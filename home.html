    <h3>Versions A and B</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered"><div class="ABdiv">
      <div class="pagediv smallshadow">
        <h4>Version A: vertical flow</h4><img src="photos/Design A.gif" class="pagephoto" alt="version A of website">
      </div>
      <div class="pagediv smallshadow">
        <h4>Version B: horizontal flow</h4><img src="photos/Design B.png" class="pagephoto" alt="version B of website">
      </div>
    </div></div>

    <br>
    <div class="centered" style="flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
      <p>I ran statistical tests on two metrics:</p>
      <p><b>Time to Completion</b> (Time it takes to order cacti)</p>
      <p><b>Return Rate</b> (Number of times a user returned to the page)</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="centered"><div class="hypothesisdiv">
      <h3>Hypotheses</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The null hypothesis for Time to Completion is that there is no difference
        in the time it takes to order cacti. My alternative hypothesis is that 
        users will take longer to order on version A because they have to scroll
        back and forth to see all the items.
      </p>
      <p>The null hypothesis for Return Rate is that there will be no difference between
        the return rates for the two sites. My alternative hypothesis is that the return 
        rate for version A will be higher, because users may return if they feel like they
        missed an item, and this is easy to do when the items are more spread out.
      </p>

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered"><div style="width: 80%">
      <p style="text-align: center;">I created a link that would open to version A of the site 50% of the time and version B 50% of the time.
        The link was sent to 40 people, who were instructed to fill their cart with at least $150
        worth of plants. Afterwards I opened Heroku's logs to see what happened. 
      </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered"><div style="width: 80%">
      <ul>
        <li>The test accuracy was limited by the low number of test users. Only 19 people filled 
          out the survey, making it hard to reach statistical significance.
        </li>
        <li>Although it didn't reach significance, the time users spent on Version A trended longer,
          which makes sense because of the excessive scrolling the page demands. Generally, good 
          design should make all necessary information as accessible as possible.
        </li>
        <li>It's important to choose the right metrics for evaluating the two versions against
          each other. Would time to completion or return rate actually correllate with increased 
          revenue on the site? It would be interesting to test click-through rate or 
          money spent as additional metrics.
        </li>
      </ul>

          <h6><b>Lessons Learned</b></h6>
          <h6>This project taught me how to collect concrete data on webpage performance metrics
            and use statistics to analyze the effectiveness of different designs. Doing A/B testing
            led me to consider the impact small design changes can have on site performance, potentially
            in unexpected ways.
